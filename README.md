Just another repository 

Hey, I'm Timmy. I'm a stand up comedian and photographer in Los Angeles. I guess I would better be described as a story teller. Currently going through Code Academies 10 week, building websites from scratch intensive and am not really liking how much I enjoy writing the code. Maybe this will change, but I don't like that I like doing the work.
